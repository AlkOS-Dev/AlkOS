## Running
```shell
cd build
cmake ..
make
qemu-system-i386 -kernel ./bin/alkos.bin
```

## Clion setup
I have achieved proper syntax support in CLion by going to
`Build | Execution | Deployment -> CMake` and then creating a custom profile 'i686-elf' with the following settings:
- CMake options: `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={absolute_path_to_this_repo}/cmake-scripts/i686-elf-toolchain.cmake`

It may be possible to use a relative path, but I have not tested this.

With this setup it is possible to run the project by adding a new configuration with the following settings:
- Name: `QEMU i686-elf`
- Executable: `alkos_cli`
- Program arguments: `-v -r`
